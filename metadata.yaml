description: Hamlin Garland followed up his collection of short stories titled Main-Travelled
  Roads with Other Main-Travelled Roads . Unsparing in their depiction of the harsh
  realities of Midwestern farm life, these stories are quintessential examples of
  Garland's writing. Stories include, William Bacon's Man," A Fair Exile," and A Preacher's
  Love Story."
